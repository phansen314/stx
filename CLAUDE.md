# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A local todo/kanban app (`todo` CLI) with two interfaces: CLI (argparse) and TUI (Textual), backed by SQLite storage. All layers are fully implemented. Use `--json` flag for structured CLI output. Use the `/todo` command for full CLI reference.

## Architecture

```
CLI commands ────────┐
TUI event handlers ──┤──▶ Service ──▶ Repository ──▶ Connection ──▶ SQLite
```

**Data hierarchy:** Board → Column → Task (and Board → Project → Task, Board → Tag ↔ Task). Columns are board-scoped and represent kanban workflow stages. No data is ever deleted — use `archived` flags instead.

## CLI

Entry point: `todo = "sticky_notes.__main__:main"`.

**Active board:** persisted at `~/.local/share/sticky-notes/active-board`. CLI resolves board from `--board`/`-b` flag, falling back to this file. Set via `todo board create` or `todo board use`.

**Command structure:**
- Top-level task commands: `add`, `ls`, `show`, `edit`, `mv`, `rm`, `log`
- Subcommand groups: `board`, `col`, `project`, `dep`, `tag`, `export`

## TUI

Entry point: `todo tui` (or `todo tui --db path/to/db`).

**Architecture:** `StickyNotesApp` → `BoardView` (main widget) → `ColumnWidget` → `TaskCard`. Screens are `ModalScreen[T]` overlays that dismiss with typed results via callbacks.

**Keybindings (on TaskCard focus):**
- `enter` — task detail modal (read-only)
- `e` — edit task (form pre-populated)
- `d` / `delete` — archive task (with optional confirmation)
- `n` — new task in focused column
- Arrow keys — navigate grid; `shift+left`/`shift+right` — move task between columns

**Screen patterns:**
- `ConfirmDialog(ModalScreen[bool])` — generic yes/no, reusable for any destructive action
- `TaskDetailModal(ModalScreen[int | None])` — dismisses with `None` (close) or task_id (edit transition)
- `TaskFormModal(ModalScreen[dict | None])` — dual-mode (`Literal["create", "edit"]`), dismisses with field dict or `None` (cancel)

**Key conventions:**
- Deferred screen imports in `board_view.py` handler methods to avoid circular deps between widgets and screens
- `BoardView.reload(focus_task_id=None)` is the single re-render path — all mutations call it
- `BoardView._board_id` cached during `_load_board()` — handlers use it instead of fishing from column slots
- `TaskFormModal` takes `conn` + `board_id` in constructor (pre-mount data fetching), `default_priority` as explicit param — no `typed_app` access before mount
- Edit diffs form result against current DB state for minimal `update_task` changes dict
- Config at `~/.config/sticky-notes/tui.toml` — theme, show_archived, confirm_archive, default_priority

## Key Design Conventions

- **Separate pre-insert and persisted types** — `NewTask` (no `id`/`created_at`) vs `Task` (full row). Never use `None` as a stand-in for "not yet assigned."
- **ListItem vs Detail service models** — two tiers of denormalization for tasks. `TaskListItem` is a flat dataclass of Task fields plus resolved display names (`project_name`, `tag_names`) for list rendering without per-row lookups. `TaskDetail` is a flat dataclass of Task fields plus fully hydrated relationships (`column`, `project`, `group`, `blocked_by`, `blocks`, `history`, `tags`) for single-entity views. Both redeclare Task fields directly — they do not inherit from `Task`. `GroupRef` is the only surviving Ref type, used by `build_group_tree` / `GroupTreeNode` to walk the hierarchy without hydrating every group. `BoardListView` is the aggregate view model for `cmd_ls` — board + ordered columns + TaskListItems. `BoardContext` is the aggregate view model for `cmd_context` — `BoardListView` + projects + tags + groups, for one-call AI session startup.
- **All dataclasses are frozen** — immutability throughout. Changes produce new instances via DB.
- **Defaults on pre-insert dataclasses** — optional/defaultable fields on `New*` types carry defaults directly. No factory layer needed.
- **Service models are flat, not inherited** — `TaskListItem`, `TaskDetail`, `ProjectDetail`, and `GroupDetail` redeclare their parent entity's fields rather than inheriting from `Task` / `Project` / `Group`. Tradeoff: adding a column to `tasks` touches both `TaskListItem` and `TaskDetail` in addition to `Task` and `row_to_task`. The win is that hydrated fields can be plain required annotations (e.g. `column: Column` on `TaskDetail`) without dataclass field-ordering gymnastics. An earlier inheritance-based version required `column: Column = None  # type: ignore` with a runtime `__post_init__` check — flat redeclaration removes that hack.
- **Mappers are plain functions** — explicit conversion at each layer boundary (row→model, model→ref, ref→detail). Models are pure data containers with no methods — conversion logic stays in `mappers.py`, not as classmethods. Accept the boilerplate to keep separation clean.
- **`shallow_fields()` helper** — extracts a dataclass's fields as a dict for splatting into derived types (`TaskListItem`, `TaskDetail`, `GroupRef`, etc.). Lives in `mappers.py`.
- **Repository update allowlists** — each entity has a `_*_UPDATABLE` frozenset guarding which fields can be passed to update functions.
- **Task history / audit trail** — `_record_changes()` in the service layer auto-records `TaskHistory` entries for changed fields. `TaskField` enum defines trackable fields.
- **Transaction context manager** — service layer controls transaction boundaries. Repository functions receive a connection and never commit/rollback. On rollback failure, `raise exc from rollback_exc` — the original error is primary, rollback failure is attached as `__cause__`. This is intentional.
- **Timestamps as Unix epoch integers** — formatting happens at the edges only. `parse_date` and `format_timestamp` live in `formatting.py` (shared by CLI and TUI).
- **Task numbers** — formatted as `task-{id:04d}` in the application layer, derived from autoincrement ID. `format_task_num` and `format_priority` also live in `formatting.py`.
- **Active board file** — persisted at `~/.local/share/sticky-notes/active-board`. CLI resolves board from `--board` flag or this file.
- **Tags** — board-scoped, many-to-many with tasks via `task_tags` junction table. `tag_task` auto-creates the tag if it doesn't exist. Composite FKs enforce same-board scoping at the DB level.
- **Error translation** — `_friendly_errors()` context manager in the service layer catches `IntegrityError` and translates to `ValueError` with human-readable messages. `_UNIQUE_MESSAGES` dict maps constraint patterns to messages.
- **Service-layer pre-validation** — `_validate_task_fields()` checks scalar constraints (priority range, position >= 0, date ordering) and cross-entity constraints (column/project exists, on correct board, not archived) before hitting the DB.
- **Migrations** — numbered SQL files in `src/sticky_notes/migrations/` (e.g., `003_schema_hardening.sql`). `_run_migrations()` discovers files by version prefix, wraps each in FK-off + transaction + FK-revalidate. SQL files contain only DDL/DML — no PRAGMAs, no transaction control. `SCHEMA_VERSION` is explicit; a test asserts it matches the highest migration file number. Fresh databases skip migrations entirely (`init_db` runs `schema.sql` and stamps `SCHEMA_VERSION`).
- **Export** — `export.py` renders the full database to Markdown with Mermaid dependency graphs.
- **DB path** — `~/.local/share/sticky-notes/sticky-notes.db` (XDG-compliant).
- **WAL journal mode** — enables concurrent reads from TUI and CLI.

## Testing

- **pytest** with `pytest-cov`; fixtures in `conftest.py`, raw SQL insert helpers in `tests/helpers.py`
- Fresh in-memory DB per test — no cross-test pollution
- Test files cover all layers: connection, repository, service, mappers, export, CLI, TUI
- TUI tests use Textual's `app.run_test()` pilot API with `seeded_tui_db` fixture (from `tests/seed.py`)
- `seed.py` also runnable standalone: `python tests/seed.py tmp/test.db` for manual smoke testing
